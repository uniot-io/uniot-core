# Introduction

Uniot Core is the heartbeat of the Uniot Platform, designed to seamlessly power IoT devices. As a highly optimized open source operating system, it serves as a crucial component, enabling efficient task scheduling, networking, storage management, and more. With its own script sandbox, Uniot Core allows secure and fast direct execution of scripts directly on the device.

## Compatibility

Currently, Uniot Core is optimized for ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers, two of the most popular platforms for IoT development. The decision to base Uniot Core on the Arduino framework and implement it in C++ is rooted in a commitment to accessibility, performance, and community collaboration. Arduino's user-friendly nature, coupled with the efficiency of C++, enables developers to create and scale applications with ease. The platform also benefits from a vast ecosystem of existing libraries and a thriving developer community.
